- IF-0-ALPHA-1 — a thing

## Phases

### Phase 0 — First Thing (ALPHA)

**Objective**
Do the first thing.

**Exit criteria**
- [ ] EC-ALPHA-1 — proven by `pytest`

**Scope notes**
decompose into 2 lanes; disjoint files.

**Non-goals**
None.

**Key files**
- `src/alpha.py`
- `src/shared.py`

**Depends on**
- (none)

**Produces**
- IF-0-ALPHA-1

### Phase 1 — Second Thing (BETA)

**Objective**
Do the second thing.

**Exit criteria**
- [ ] EC-BETA-1 — proven by `pytest`

**Scope notes**
decompose into 2 lanes; disjoint files.

**Non-goals**
None.

**Key files**
- `src/beta/`
- `src/shared.py`

**Depends on**
- ALPHA

**Produces**
- (none)
